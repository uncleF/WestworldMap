    <h2>Band history</h2>
    <p><strong>Primus began as <span data-dev-note="note">Primate</span> in El Sobrante, California</strong> during the mid-1980s with singer and bassist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Claypool" title="Les Claypool">Les Claypool</a> and guitarist Todd Huth. Claypool rounded out the band with a drum machine which they named Perm Parker.[1] The band would go through many drummers throughout their early history, eventually settling on Jay Lane. When another band called "Primate" threatened legal action, the group decided to change their name.[citation needed] Claypool selected Primus instead after looking up the word directly next to "Primate" in a dictionary.[citation needed] The word is Latin, meaning "chief" or "first".</p>
    <h3>Текст</h3>
    <p>After rising to local <em>music scene stardom with their brand of funk metal fusion</em>, Huth and Lane left in 1989 to pursue other projects. Claypool then recruited former Blind Illusion bandmate and one time Joe Satriani student Larry "Ler" LaLonde, and eclectic drummer Tim "Herb" Alexander. In fact, Claypool &amp; LaLonde recorded &amp; toured with the early thrash band Blind Illusion whose only album "The Sane Asylum" was released on Music For Nations. Larry LaLonde was previously a member of the seminal Death/Thrash Metal band Possessed, a fact which he likes to keep quiet today. Primus received praise from Testament's Alex Skolnick very early into their career.[2] <cite>Tim Alexander is originally from Jerome, Arizona and was the drummer in Major Lingo</cite>.</p>
    <p>Primus continued to gain popularity and in 1989 released their first album, Suck on This, a live recording culled from two of their Berkeley concerts. The album was financed by Les' father.</p>
    <h4>Неформатированный текст</h4>
    <p>In 1990 the band released their first studio album, Frizzle Fry, and released singles for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_The_Fisherman" title="John The Fisherman">John The Fisherman</a>" and "Too Many Puppies". With a music video featuring Kirk Hammett, a studio album and a tour with Jane's Addiction, Primus' popularity grew to the point where they attracted attention from Interscope Records, who signed them in 1990.</p>

    <p>The unary plus and minus operators are familiar symbols to most developers and operate the same way in ECMAScript as they do in high — school math. The unary plus is represented by a single plus sign ( + ) placed before a variable and does nothing to a numeric value, as shown in this example: <code>var <var title="num">num</var> = 25;</code></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are," replied the girl steadily, "give away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths--even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them. When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffin lid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?</p>
      <p>The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes. Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Critics George Gissing and G. K. Chesterton championed Dickens's mastery of prose, his endless invention of unique, clever personalities, and his powerful social sensibilities, but fellow writers such as George Henry Lewes, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf faulted his work for sentimentality, implausible occurrences, and grotesque characterizations.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
    <p>The <small>popularity</small> of Dickens's <big>novels</big> and short stories has meant that they have never gone out of print.[2][3] Many of Dickens's novels first appeared in periodicals and magazines in serialised forma popular format for fiction at the timeand, unlike many other authors who completed entire novels before serial production commenced, Dickens often composed his works in parts, in the order in which they were meant to appear. Such a practice lent his stories a particular rhythm, punctuated by <del datetime="1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00" cite="http://www.foo.org/mydoc/comments.html">one minor "cliffhanger" after another, to keep the public looking forward to the next installment.[4]</del></p>
